============

Unknown drinking at the bar.
Nim trying to charm his way into a job singing at the tavern
Kaashak enters looking for work, directed to the job board. Nim, having been turned down for a job, joins him. Unknown, trying to avoid paying her tab, sneaks out among them.

Job Board
=========

Three jobs - Kashaak takes rat job, returns to tavern to find location of job and goes there, killing a good 20 rats.
Nim and Unknown go to a house to repair its roof. While Nim is outside scoping out the job, Unknown enters the house and steals a small wooden box. She leaves without being noticed.

Kashaak returns to the job board to take the last job, gathering of wolf pelts for Mary's Cloakes. He goes to the tavern to ask directions for someone who has pelts. Eventually directed to the Hunter's Guild.

Unknown shows Nim the way to the hardware store to buy wood for the wood. Unknown slips away and goes to her fence, where she sells the box and it's small collection of jewellery.

On way back to tavern, Unknown meets Kashaak and they both go to the Hunter's Guild to inquire about wolf pelts. They are given general direction for known wolf spots, and are challenged to clear a nearby dwarf mine of an 'infestation'.

They head back towards the tavern and split up.

Nim purchases the wood for the roof and takes them back to the house, on the way he bumps into Kaashak and he helps carry the wood to the house. He also lends his rope to Nim. With the rope, and some small pieces of wood, Nim makes a rudimentary pulley to help get the wood up to the roof.

Meanwhile, Unknown has gone back to the tavern and used some of her ill-gotten money to pay off her bar-tab.

Kaashak goes to a nearby shop to research purchasing a ranged weapon, but doesn't have enough gold.

Nim completes a good portion of the roof, and after a quick supper provided by the owner of the house, he returns to the Empty Bucket.

Empty Bucket
============

All three are now at the empty bucket and both Nim and Raashak decide to split a single room, Nim sleeping on the floor.

After a simple breakfast, all three decide to finish the roof together, and get it done in half a day.

Out-of-town
===========

All three decide to go wolf-hunting together.

Kaashak goes stealth, and the other two lose him.

Nim and Unknown find a sleeping wolf under a larged branched tree. Kaashak, who had been following the other two, comes out of stealth, startling Unknown. Together they kill the wolf, and another that came to its aid. The take the pelts, and a few other things.

Looking for more wolves, they come across smoke. They stealth up and find two kolbolds around a cooking pot.

After killing them, the group enter the abandonded dwarf mine they were guarding. After a few battles, and a little looting, they find that the kobolds are feeding, and actually worshipping, a Giant Octupus that is living in the underground lake.

A long, bloody battle ensues and the Gnome Bard Nim takes the killing blow. More looting occurs and the group returns to town to sell the pelts at Mary's Cloakes and Clothes.

Empty Bucket
============

Returning to the tavern, Nim finally convinces Tom that he is a decent musician and manages to sing for his lodgings.

The group sleep and the first part of the story is done.

Kashaak levels up.

Job Board
=========

In the morning, the three wake up and Unknown and Nim head to the message board to look for jobs. They see a single job, for collecting the harvest.

Meanwhile Kashaak goes to the Hunter's Guild to start an initiation. He is told to return in a few hours when someone will take him on his initial Hunt for the guild.

Nim does a little light shopping, while unknown goes to kill a bird to get a feather for Nim's magic.

Outside of Town
===============

They all meet up and exit the South Gate to search for wolves to pelt. They find some tracks that look like wolf tracks, but are far bigger. They also spot blood along the trail.

The Cave
========

They eventually find a cave where the wolf prints end. Kashaak realises the time and starts heading back to town to go to the Hunters Guild while Nim and Unknown enter the cave. They trigger a trap at its entrance, but manage to dodge out of its way.

The continue to enter and hear a wolf further ahead. They continue and find a small room at the end which contains the wolf and a man that appears to be patching up a wound on his leg.

Nim calls out to see if the man needs aid, to which the man responds by telling them to leave. After refusing to do so, the man commands his wolf to attack them.

After a brief spout, Unknown grabs the small gnome, Nim, and drags him out of the cave, leaving the wolf and the man behind.

Hunters Guild
=============

Rashaak returns to the Hunters Guild and accepts the initiation mission. Guided by a guild member, he goes on the hunt for a brown bear. After a short following of tracks, the bear is tracked down, but proves too much for the lone Rashaak to handle.

He returns to The Cave to see if his friends are still there but instead finds the man and his wolf. After a brief bout, upon which Kashaak is definitely on the losing end, he runs away and returns to the Town.

Job Board
=========

On the way back to the tavern, Unknown glances at the job board and reads the notice about the harvest job. She immediately sees the hidden code within in and knows that the Thieves Guild is offering a special job. Unknown returns to the tavern with Nim.

Empty Bucket
============

After a non-productive day, Unknown settles down to get some quality drinking time seen to and Nim once again sings for his lodgings.

Rashaak arrives and goes straight to his room.

After a quick breakfast the next morning, Unknown slips away from the party to go see her Fence friend, whom she knows is a member of the Thieves Guild.

She learns that a 'Special Item' was stolen from the Thieves Guild by an ex-member, and a bounty has been placed for the return of the item and the head of the man who stole it. She is given a brief description of the man and is told that he had a 'large dog' with him. She realises this is the same man that they fought the previous day and returns to the tavern.

She meets up with the other two who have decided to go back to the cave as a group to confront the man and his wolf. Unknown goes along with this.

The Cave
========

Rashaak rushes into the cave, narrowly missing a newly set trap, and is immediately attacked by the wolf. The other two arrive shortly afterwards and the three of them manage to dispatch the wolf and the thief with a little effort.

Seeing Unknown unsuccessully attempt to cut off the head of the man, Rashaak helps with a single clean blow.

While Nim removes the pelt of what he has now realised is a Dire-Wolf, Rashaak and Unknown search the room. Rashaak discovers an unusual feature of the room, but cannot do anything with it. Upon inspection, Unknown recognises it as a thief safe and manages to get it open. Inside is a small, shiny, metal box.

Taking the head and the box, Unknown, accomponied by the others, returns to town.

Hunters Guild
=============

With the pelt of a Dire-Wolf, Nim tries to sign up to the Hunter's Guild. May tells him that his initiation could begin in the morning. He then leaves to go to shopping.

The Fence
=========

Meanwhile, Unknown meets with her fence, who is very happy upon seeing the head of the dead thief and the box returned intact. Unknown is paid a reward and leaves to find the others.

Mary's Cloaks
=============

After meeting up, the three head to the Cloak store to sell there wolf pelt. After doing so, Rashaak and Nim ask to see the metal box, to see if they can determing what it is.

Uknown tries to convince them that she lost it, but is unable to decieve them. A short argument leads into Rashaak hitting Unknown. Mary orders the three to leave her shop. When Rashaak refuses, she calls for the guards who forcibly remove them from the store.

Outside, Unknown stalks off and Rashaak raises a javelin as if to throw it at her. The guard quickly grabs the javelin and tells Rashaak to calm down. Upon refusing to, Rashaak is arrested and escorted to the nearest holding cell where he stays the night.

Empty Bucket
============

Nim plays for his lodgings again and after a bring stint of drinking, Unknown goes to sleep.

Nim and Unknown level up.

Upon waking, Unknown finds a note has been left for her. It appears to be from the Thieves Guild, and is inviting her to join.

Roshaak is released and joins his allies at tavern. After a small breakfast, they all leave to go to the Hunter Guild to start the initiation.

Hunters Guild
=============

Ander takes the three on the initiation. They attack a bear and have nearly dispatched it when another appears. They finish up the first and make short work of the second.

Ander grudgingly admits that they have passed the test and inform them that they are now members of the Guild and are free to take Hunters Guild quests.

Ander stays to carve up the bears and the trio return to the city.

Road
====

On the road outside of Fallcrest the team spot a Merchant and two would-be bandits that are sneaking up behind him. Rashaak charges towards the bandits and Unknown shoots at them.

The team take down the two thugs and are then approached by another, better dressed bandit. He states that his two friends appear to have failed the test and attacks the group.

With the help of the merchant and his crossbow, the three take down the last bandit.

Grateful for the help, the merchant hires the group to guard him on the way to Cloahpool, the city to the west.

They direct the merchant, Sylis Olomyar, to the tavern. While Nim and Unknown goes to the shops to sell the gear looted from the bandits, Raashak heads to the hunters guild to inquire about jobs.

Empty Bucket
============

The team regroup at the tavern and stay the night. Nim performs well enough to get a free room for the night.

The next morning the group and Sylis head for Cloahpool. Upon exiting the town, Sylis informs the groups that he would prefer to avoid the roads and keep under cover.

Wilderness
==========

For the next two days the group travel with little difficulty, although they do see what appears to be a dragon fly overhead. It doesn't appear to spot them.

During the night, Raashak spots the creature again and alerts the group.

A White Wyrmling lands and a Drow immediately jumps off of its back and goes to attack Sylis.

The team make short work of the Drow, but the Wyrmling takes a little more effort, but they do manage to kill it.

After the fight, the team interrogate the supposed merchant and ask why he would have been targeted by a dragon.

Some persuasion and a little intimidation later, Sylis confesses to be carrying a message for the Lord of Cloahpool. A key to a prison has been stolen and the Lord needs to be informed.

Sylis offer a bonus of 30gp each for the killing of the dragon and for keeping the secret.

They decide to forgoe sleep and travel throught the night to reach Cloahpool by morning.

Cloahpool
=========

Taking Sylis directly to the Lord's keep, Sylis asks them to wait at the Melting Pot, a nearby tavern. Being slightly untrusting of Sylis, Raashak follows him into the Lords keep, but is stopped by guards trying to enter the main chamber.

Raashak joins the others at the tavern and waits for Sylis to return.

They ask the barman to see if there is a Hunters Guild in town. They find out there isn't, but that there is a Fighters Guild.

On the way to the Fighters Guild, they stop off at an armourer to see if they can turn their dragon scales into anything. The armourer tells them he can make a Dragon Scale shield with them. They leave the scales with him to pick the shield up in the morning.

They go to the Fighters Guild to see about joining. They are told that anyone can fight here, and that fights are usually scheduled after the work day is done. Nim signs up to possibly fight.

The party heads back to the tavern, getting into an argument with some guards over not letting them into the High Area.

At the tarvern, they find Sylis waiting. He proceeds to give them their gold and tells them about a mission he would like them to partake in.

He asks them to find the Eye of the Raven Queen. A magical device somehow connected with the Raven Queen, the Goddess of Death. It is needed to try and find the missing key. They are fronted 1000GP and promised another 1000GP upon retrieval of the item.

Given what they know of the Raven Queen, the association with death, they head to the prison to see if any murderers know anything of the Goddess. They meet a prisoner who tells them that he is not a holy man, and knows little of holy matters.

The team split up, with Raashak heading to a local temple, and Nim and Unknown heading to the local library.

Both teams find out that there used to be a temple to the Raven Queen in the mountains to the South.

The team meet up again and decide to do a little shopping. They find a wizard running a nearby item shop and ask him to try and scry for the Eye. He does so and tells them that is is being stored in a dark room, a long way to the South East. He sees what he thinks is a man walk passed a corridor outside the room. The team buy a few items and leave to go back to the tavern.

In the morning they pick up the shield and leave to go south.

The party moves quickly through Dewsbury and Azmar, ending up at the Azmar Pass, which goes through the mountains to Southern Taldoran.

Azmar Pass
==========

After carefully crossing a dangerous looking rope bridge, the party run into a group of Centaurs who inform them that the temple is nearby and given them some landmarks to look out for.

A little farther on, the party hear a stuck Centaur that got separated from its group. Raashak frees the centaurs foot by removing the rock trapping its foot. In thanks, the Centaur gifts the party its +1 Longbow.

Temple of the Raven Queen
=========================

The team eventually come to the massive doors of the temple of the Raven Queen. Opening the doors they see the massive entrance hall and enter, Unknown staying slight behind. Raashak and Nim look into one of the side rooms and alert a band of Goblins. An extended fight occurs with many Goblins, Hobgoblins and Bugbears.

After a short rest, the party start looting the bodies and searching the temple. Raashak and Nim explore the rest of the rooms. Raashak discovers a room with a rapier (+1) and some gold, while Nim discovers some magical arrows. He identifies two of them as fire arrows, but is unable to identify the third.

They all follow a tunnel leading out from the main hall, but they discover it has caved in. They see evidence that the various goblins and Bugbears were in the process of clearing it out, but there seems to be a lot still to do. Nim and Unknown rest while Raashak goes in search of the Centaurs to see if they can help. Unable to find them, he heads back.

Reunited, the team decide to continue through the mountains to Irragin and stay the night. Nim posts a sign up on a local job board for people to come and help dig out the temple.

Irragin
=======

Meanwhile, Raashak asks around and finds out that a local family, the Dwarven Moireach's, are a family rumoured to be connected with the Raven Queen. He asks for their where-a-bouts and is directed to an estate a few miles out of town. After a little shopping, he goes to investigate.

Meanwhile, Nim and Unknown wait around to see if anyone will respond to the job notice.

Moireach Manor
==============

Raashak arrives at Moireach Manor and is greeted by a Dwarf, the owner of the house. Raashak asks him if he knows anything about the Raven Queen. Moireach says that his family was once acolytes of the Raven Queen.

Raashak asks if there is perhaps a seconds, accessible entrance to the temple. Moireach claims there is, but is unwilling to reveal its existence at first, until Raashak convinces him. Raashak is led down to the basement and shown a secret entrance behind some shelves. He looks into the cavern behind the shelves and says he'll be back with his friends soon.

Raashak heads back to town.

Irragin
=======

As noone seem to be interested in a job moving rocks in a temple dedicated to the Goddess of Death, Nim heads to a local blacksmith to see about getting some weapons silvered. He is quoted a price of 50GP to get a longsword silvered. He heads back to the tavern.

Raashak arrives back in town and find Unknown at the tavern. Together they look around town for Nim, eventually being led to the blacksmiths. Raashak decides to get his longsword silvered. The blacksmith takes it and says he'll be done by the morning.

The party meet up again at the tavern and sleep the night.

In the morning Raashak tells the others of his discoveries at Moireach manor and, after picking up his sword from the blacksmiths, they all head back to it.

Moireach Manor
==============

A few hours later, they arrive at the manor and are greeted by Moireach. He helpfully equips them with some vials of Holy Water and two potions. He also gives them a Crystal Ball of Returning that, when crushed, will teleport the crusher and anyone standing next to them straight to the basement of this house. The trio go through the hidden door in the basement and head into the darkness.

Under the Mountains
===================

After a couple of hours of underground travel, the team find their way into a large cavern, the sound of water rushing in the near-distance. Raashak is surprised by an attack from an undead foe. The team quickly recognise their enemy as a Zombie and start their counter attack. A short battle with several zombies and a skeleton is won with only a little difficulty.

After a short rest, the team advance and find the source of the noise, an underground river. They find a stone bridge and cross with ease. On the other side they spot a dead body on the ground. Preemptively, Unknown fires an arrow into the body. Nothing happens. Raashak approaches and narrowly escapes being swipped ay by the, apparantly, undead body. He makes short work of it and decapitates it instantly. As he does, he sees a medallian fall of its neck. He grabs it and puts it on.

Following the cavern along the team discover more zombies and effortlessly, and stealthily, kill them.

While fighting, Unknown spots some faint light moving in the distance.

Raashak throws a rock towards them, but it takes much longer to land and make a noise than he would expect.

The team advance and find a massive ravine with a rope bridge. They cannot see the otherside, or the bottom. They quietly cross.

Getting impatient for a fight, Raashak yells out at the moving lights. Shortly after, out of the darkness come three Magic Missiles aimed right for him. Scared, Raashak runs back over to the bridge, first pausing to tie his rope to the post. Many zombies and skeletons approach, followed by a Flaming Skull.

While both Raashak and Unknown dash across the bridge, Nim tries to hide in the darkness.

As Raashak makes it to the other side of the bridge he is hit again by three Magic Missiles, only barely staying alive. Dropping his rope, he decides to keeps on running.

Nim is attacked by a trio of zombies that split off from the larger herd and Unknown tries to fight the first Flaming Skull, taking hits from both as she does.

After getting some distance away, Raashak uses his heavy crossbow to deal some damage to the Skull right at Unknown. The Skull retaliates and knocks Raashak out.

Alone, against two Flaming Skulls, Unknown manages to take one down, but is bested by the other.

Nim manages to defeat the three zombies at him and sneak past all the other enemies, that have now returned to this side of the ravine and gets to Unknown as she is on the brink of death and saves her. He drags her to Raashak and finds him unconcious, but stable. Healing him so he can move, the three slowly return to Moireach Manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Having suffered their first defeat, the team are despondent and upon arriving, Moireach offers rooms for them to recover in.

The next morning, as Unknown rests, trying to recover from her near-death experience, Nim and Raashak head to Irragin, Nim to buy a drum and a belt, and Raashak to look for information about the undead. Finding nothing useful, Raashak and Nim head back to Moireach Manor. Along the way, they find some tracks and decide to follow them East.

Wolarb Marsh
============

After an hour of following tracks, Nim and Raashak end up in a marsh. The two come across some snakes, that they switly deal with. Deciding that they've followed far enough, they head back to the manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Nima and Raashak return to the Manor and talk to Moireach about the temple and the undead. Moireach advises not going back down, but that Holy Water should help with defeating them.

In the morning, while Unknown remains resting, Nim starts praticing a spell he believes will help with the upcoming fight with the undead. Meanwhile, Raashak begins hunting around the manor looking for tracks.

He eventually find some tracks, that look like pawprints - bigger than a wolfs, but smaller than the direwolf's he'd seen before. After a few hours, he manages to track down a Death Dog. A fierce fight ensues and although he wins, Raashak is poisoned.

Raashak returns to the manor to find Nim practicing a spell - they both go inside and Nim explains his plan to both Unknown and Raashak. He plans to cast a Ritual of Silence on the Flaming Skulls and have Raashak get in close to not allow the Flaming Skull to leave the area of influence.

In the morning, Raashak realises that he is still poisoned and that his maximum HP has dropped. He decides to head back to Irragin to get a potion to cure him. When he arrives back Raashak, Nim and Unknown all go into the underground passage and head back towards the temple.

Under the Mountains
===================

It takes a few hours to get back to the first cavern and when they get there the three find the remains of the bodies they killed before. The head over udnerground river using the stone bridge and proceed to enter the next cavern. As they enter they a floating skull hovering around the location that Unknown had previously killed one. It appears to have regenerated itself.

Nim and Unknown hide behind a stalagmite and Nim begins casting a Silence Ritual aimed at the Skull. While this is happening, Raashak slowly creeps forwards towards the skull. As Nim finishes the spell, Unknown takes a shot at the skull and Raashak rushes forward. A short fight ensues and the team manage to easily take down the Skull.

Raashak, wanting to take no chances, sprinkles Holy Water on the skull and then procedes to throw it into the near-by ravine.

Now standing at the edge of the ravine, the team can see the light from the second skull in the distance. They stealthily cross the bridge and they decide to try the same plan again. Nim casts another Silence Ritual and Raashak prepares to run forward. As Nim is finishing the spell, he gives a nod to Raashak who now runs forward and charges the skull. The three manage to again, now working efficiently as a team, easily take down the Skull and the surrounding Zombies and Skeletons.

Nim throws the Skull over the edge of the ravine and the three settle down for a short rest.

Rested, the team proceed into the cave system. Not far on, the reach a fork in the tunnel. The left passage seems to head up and the right slopes down and to the left. Seeing some rubble at the bottom of the left slope, Nim forms an idea and, asking the others to wait for a moment, he heads up the left passage which he quickly discovers is blocked to due a cave in.

Nim returns to the others and tells them his discovery. The three decide that this is the passage that leads to the main entrance to the temple in the mountains and head down the left route.

After a few hundred meters, they get to an opening with a ceiling higher than they can easily see. Looking forward, they spot a light moving around. They try to stealth forward, but fail and the Flaming Skull starts to attack them. With Nim casting a Silence spell and Unknown and Rashaak managing to mostly keep the Flaming Skull in that area, it's quickly defeated.

After the fight, Nim notices another skull on the floor, this one cracked. Nim tries to destroy the skull, but fails. About to throw it, Nim holds it above his head and Raashak fires his crossbow at the skull, shattering it.

While this is going on, Unknown spots, above them, a rope bridge. Further on Nim spots and dangling rope hanging down the right wall. Nim climbs up it and takes a look around.

While Nim climbs up, Raashak fire his crossbow into the darkness in front of them and pays attention for a reaction. After getting no reaction, he moves forward to wear his bolt landed. When he gets there, he sees, in the distance a slight shimmer. Raashak moves back to Unknown at the rope.

Unknown and Raashak both climb up the rope and take a look around. Rashakk tells them both of the shimmer as they head towards the rope bridge. Getting to the bridge, they discover a rope tied to it - a rope tied to another which was is tied to the other end of the bridge. They realise it's the rope that Raashak tied to the bridge before and that they've gone around in a circle. Nim retrieves the rope and Raashak climbs back down.

Not wanting to climb back down, Nim pulls up the rope. While doing that, Unknown notices the piton used to anchor the rope and the Thieves Guild symbol engraved on it.

Nim and Unknown both go back round following the same route they did before and meet up with Raashak. They proceed forward to examine the shimmer.

They are attacked by three ghasts. It's a struggle, but they do manage to defeat them.

A short rest later they proceed forward and come to a stepped pyramid, made from a black, slightly shiney stone.

Speaking a little too loudly, Raashak is attacked by a ray coming from the top of the pyramid. Nim and Unknown hide against the wall of the pyramid and Raashak fires a shot in the direction of the ray.

Coming out of the darkness, the team see an undead beholder, and coming around the side of the pyramid are two zombies.

It's a long, touch fight, with Unknown nearly getting vapourised in a single hit, but the party manage to kill the enemies and get to the top of the temple.

Instead of the relic they were hoping to find, they spot an alter. They determine is was used for sacrifices to the Raven Queen. Unknown notices a symbol painted on the alter - it's the symbol of the Thieves Guild.

Nim notices some large groves cut into the right side of the top of the pyramid and, looking over the shear edge, notice many holes in the pyramid wall. It looks like someone has used climbing gear to sneak up the side of the pyramid.

Realising that the Eye of the Raven Queen has probably been stolen, and remembering back to the Wizards scrying and determining that this is not the place that he was describing, the team start to head back to Moireach manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Getting back at late night, the team go straight to bed.

They all level up.

In the morning, they ask Moireach for directions to the nearest city. He hands them a map and points to Huckson, to the East.

In a hurry now, the party decides to cut across Wolarb Marsh to get to Huckson quicker.

Wolarb Marsh
============

They make it across half of the marsh without much difficulty and make it to the river.

While attempting to cross, they are attacked by alliagators. In the ensuing fight, Nim is taken down, but the other two manage to prevail. Nim is revived with a potion and they all cross the river.

They make it throw the marsh and manage to find a road. They follow the road to the city of Huckson.

Huckson
======

Now in Hukson, they start creating plans for how to find a member of the Thieves Guild. They go to a local tavern and try to get the attention of any members of the Guild by having Unknown use thieves cant in a conversation. It doesn't appear to work and they retire for the evening.

Raashak levels up.

In the morning, the party decide to leave a message on the job board, written with Thieves Cant, with the hidden message Fountain, West Gate, Midnight.

To kill time, the team head towards the Fighter's Guild to see about entering into a fight. Both Raashak and Nim sign up for a fight later in the day. They learn that the fighter's guild uses the Hunter's Guild to acquire animals for it for the fights.

While Nim goes to a local Guild of Artists and Entertainers, Raashak and Unknown head to the Hunter's Guild to see if they have any jobs. When they get there, they hear a struggle 'round back and go to see what is happening. they see some hunter's wrestling with a large beast. After asking if they require help, Raashak and Unknown are told that everything is under control. After seeing another hunter cast a spell, putting the beast to sleep, the two head back 'round to the front of the Guild where they meet a member of the Guild and ask about jobs. He doesn't give any specific jobs, but does tell them that they are always on the look out for rare animal parts and even new and rare new species of creatures. Raashak sells them some parts for a little gold and he and Unknown return to the tavern where they planned to meet Nim.

At the tavern, the team decide to explore the surrounding area while waiting for the fights to start in the evening. They head west, past D'holden, a Dwarven Town, and end up back at the edge of Wolarb Marsh where they have a quick battle with some poisonous snakes and head back to Huckson.

Now later in the day, the team return to the Fighter's Guild.

They witness another first-time fighter fight a bugbear and win.

Raashak and Nim both decide to fight a bugbear each. Raashak is first up and struggles a little at the beginning, but eventually overcomes the bugbear with little difficulty.

Nim has a little more difficulty, but is equally victorious.

The team collect the winnings they had from the bets they made and stay to watch the remaining fights.

The last fight of the night is two fighters, neither new-comers to the Fighter's Guild, but neither are exceptionally experienced either. They are against a Chirmera and are swiftly knocked out. Before the Chimera can completely kill the two combatants, another member of the Guilds steps out from behind them and casts a powerful spell of the Chimera, putting it to sleep.

As it's nearing midnight, the team go the the fountain near the west gate and see if anyone will show up for their secret meeting. Nim and Raashak hide nearby and Unknown stands near the fountain, waiting for a member of the Thieves Guild. They wait for an hour, but noone appears to show up.

Nim and Unknown return to the Tavern and go to sleep. Raashak stays behind for another hour but doesn't see anything and returns to the tavern.

A few hours later, during Unknowns Meditation, she hears he door open and opens her eyes and sees a man in dark clothes leaning against the door. Unknown explains to the man that they are looking for the Eye of the Raven Queen. The man doesn't appear to know what that is and says that information is not given out freely, or cheaply, to non-members. Unknown goes and wakes up Nim and Raashak in the next room.

With the help of Nim, Unknown convinces the man to initiate them into the Thieves Guild. The thief gives them a simple task, to go to Murkshear and retrieve a bag from a dwarven ex-merchant, Targ Crest-Hammer, to whom the bag was mistakenly sold with a rare and precious item still hidden within.

After the party agrees to the initiation test, the man leaves and the team go back to their rest.

Nim and Unknown level up.

In the morning, Nim goes to a local shop and spends some of his winnings from the previous day's fights to purchase some healing potions. Afterwards, the team head out the South Gate towards Murkshear.

Road to Murkshear
=================

Half way along the road to Murkshear they party get to a bridge and see three people with large dogs. As they get closer they see that two of the dogs are infact Direwolves and one is a Deathdog. Initially acting friendly, the three men turn out to be bandits and attack the group.

A bloodly battle ensues leaving only one of the men, and none of the animals, alive.

Nim restores life to one of the other men, but the last is too far gone to heal.

The last man is told to leave and never bother them again. He takes his still living friend with him as he leaves.

The team contine to Murkshear

Murkshear
=========

The party arrive at Murkshear at night and head straight for the nearest taven, The Pink Jug, and get rooms for the night.
