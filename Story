Kaashak enters looking for work, directed to the job board. Nim, having been turned down for a job, joins him. Unknown, trying to avoid paying her tab, sneaks out among them.

Job Board
=========

Three jobs - Kashaak takes rat job, returns to tavern to find location of job and goes there, killing a good 20 rats.
Nim and Unknown go to a house to repair its roof. While Nim is outside scoping out the job, Unknown enters the house and steals a small wooden box. She leaves without being noticed.

Kashaak returns to the job board to take the last job, gathering of wolf pelts for Mary's Cloakes. He goes to the tavern to ask directions for someone who has pelts. Eventually directed to the Hunter's Guild.

Unknown shows Nim the way to the hardware store to buy wood for the wood. Unknown slips away and goes to her fence, where she sells the box and it's small collection of jewellery.

On way back to tavern, Unknown meets Kashaak and they both go to the Hunter's Guild to inquire about wolf pelts. They are given general direction for known wolf spots, and are challenged to clear a nearby dwarf mine of an 'infestation'.

They head back towards the tavern and split up.

Nim purchases the wood for the roof and takes them back to the house, on the way he bumps into Kaashak and he helps carry the wood to the house. He also lends his rope to Nim. With the rope, and some small pieces of wood, Nim makes a rudimentary pulley to help get the wood up to the roof.

Meanwhile, Unknown has gone back to the tavern and used some of her ill-gotten money to pay off her bar-tab.

Kaashak goes to a nearby shop to research purchasing a ranged weapon, but doesn't have enough gold.

Nim completes a good portion of the roof, and after a quick supper provided by the owner of the house, he returns to the Empty Bucket.

Empty Bucket
============

All three are now at the empty bucket and both Nim and Raashak decide to split a single room, Nim sleeping on the floor.

After a simple breakfast, all three decide to finish the roof together, and get it done in half a day.

Out-of-town
===========

All three decide to go wolf-hunting together.

Kaashak goes stealth, and the other two lose him.

Nim and Unknown find a sleeping wolf under a larged branched tree. Kaashak, who had been following the other two, comes out of stealth, startling Unknown. Together they kill the wolf, and another that came to its aid. The take the pelts, and a few other things.

Looking for more wolves, they come across smoke. They stealth up and find two kolbolds around a cooking pot.

After killing them, the group enter the abandonded dwarf mine they were guarding. After a few battles, and a little looting, they find that the kobolds are feeding, and actually worshipping, a Giant Octupus that is living in the underground lake.

A long, bloody battle ensues and the Gnome Bard Nim takes the killing blow. More looting occurs and the group returns to town to sell the pelts at Mary's Cloakes and Clothes.

Empty Bucket
============

Returning to the tavern, Nim finally convinces Tom that he is a decent musician and manages to sing for his lodgings.

The group sleep and the first part of the story is done.

Kashaak levels up.

Job Board
=========

In the morning, the three wake up and Unknown and Nim head to the message board to look for jobs. They see a single job, for collecting the harvest.

Meanwhile Kashaak goes to the Hunter's Guild to start an initiation. He is told to return in a few hours when someone will take him on his initial Hunt for the guild.

Nim does a little light shopping, while unknown goes to kill a bird to get a feather for Nim's magic.

Outside of Town
===============

They all meet up and exit the South Gate to search for wolves to pelt. They find some tracks that look like wolf tracks, but are far bigger. They also spot blood along the trail.

The Cave
========

They eventually find a cave where the wolf prints end. Kashaak realises the time and starts heading back to town to go to the Hunters Guild while Nim and Unknown enter the cave. They trigger a trap at its entrance, but manage to dodge out of its way.

The continue to enter and hear a wolf further ahead. They continue and find a small room at the end which contains the wolf and a man that appears to be patching up a wound on his leg.

Nim calls out to see if the man needs aid, to which the man responds by telling them to leave. After refusing to do so, the man commands his wolf to attack them.

After a brief spout, Unknown grabs the small gnome, Nim, and drags him out of the cave, leaving the wolf and the man behind.

Hunters Guild
=============

Rashaak returns to the Hunters Guild and accepts the initiation mission. Guided by a guild member, he goes on the hunt for a brown bear. After a short following of tracks, the bear is tracked down, but proves too much for the lone Rashaak to handle.

He returns to The Cave to see if his friends are still there but instead finds the man and his wolf. After a brief bout, upon which Kashaak is definitely on the losing end, he runs away and returns to the Town.

Job Board
=========

On the way back to the tavern, Unknown glances at the job board and reads the notice about the harvest job. She immediately sees the hidden code within in and knows that the Thieves Guild is offering a special job. Unknown returns to the tavern with Nim.

Empty Bucket
============

After a non-productive day, Unknown settles down to get some quality drinking time seen to and Nim once again sings for his lodgings.

Rashaak arrives and goes straight to his room.

After a quick breakfast the next morning, Unknown slips away from the party to go see her Fence friend, whom she knows is a member of the Thieves Guild.

She learns that a 'Special Item' was stolen from the Thieves Guild by an ex-member, and a bounty has been placed for the return of the item and the head of the man who stole it. She is given a brief description of the man and is told that he had a 'large dog' with him. She realises this is the same man that they fought the previous day and returns to the tavern.

She meets up with the other two who have decided to go back to the cave as a group to confront the man and his wolf. Unknown goes along with this.

The Cave
========

Rashaak rushes into the cave, narrowly missing a newly set trap, and is immediately attacked by the wolf. The other two arrive shortly afterwards and the three of them manage to dispatch the wolf and the thief with a little effort.

Seeing Unknown unsuccessully attempt to cut off the head of the man, Rashaak helps with a single clean blow.

While Nim removes the pelt of what he has now realised is a Dire-Wolf, Rashaak and Unknown search the room. Rashaak discovers an unusual feature of the room, but cannot do anything with it. Upon inspection, Unknown recognises it as a thief safe and manages to get it open. Inside is a small, shiny, metal box.

Taking the head and the box, Unknown, accomponied by the others, returns to town.

Hunters Guild
=============

With the pelt of a Dire-Wolf, Nim tries to sign up to the Hunter's Guild. May tells him that his initiation could begin in the morning. He then leaves to go to shopping.

The Fence
=========

Meanwhile, Unknown meets with her fence, who is very happy upon seeing the head of the dead thief and the box returned intact. Unknown is paid a reward and leaves to find the others.

Mary's Cloaks
=============

After meeting up, the three head to the Cloak store to sell there wolf pelt. After doing so, Rashaak and Nim ask to see the metal box, to see if they can determing what it is.

Uknown tries to convince them that she lost it, but is unable to decieve them. A short argument leads into Rashaak hitting Unknown. Mary orders the three to leave her shop. When Rashaak refuses, she calls for the guards who forcibly remove them from the store.

Outside, Unknown stalks off and Rashaak raises a javelin as if to throw it at her. The guard quickly grabs the javelin and tells Rashaak to calm down. Upon refusing to, Rashaak is arrested and escorted to the nearest holding cell where he stays the night.

Empty Bucket
============

Nim plays for his lodgings again and after a bring stint of drinking, Unknown goes to sleep.

Nim and Unknown level up.

Upon waking, Unknown finds a note has been left for her. It appears to be from the Thieves Guild, and is inviting her to join.

Roshaak is released and joins his allies at tavern. After a small breakfast, they all leave to go to the Hunter Guild to start the initiation.

Hunters Guild
=============

Ander takes the three on the initiation. They attack a bear and have nearly dispatched it when another appears. They finish up the first and make short work of the second.

Ander grudgingly admits that they have passed the test and inform them that they are now members of the Guild and are free to take Hunters Guild quests.

Ander stays to carve up the bears and the trio return to the city.

Road
====

On the road outside of Fallcrest the team spot a Merchant and two would-be bandits that are sneaking up behind him. Rashaak charges towards the bandits and Unknown shoots at them.

The team take down the two thugs and are then approached by another, better dressed bandit. He states that his two friends appear to have failed the test and attacks the group.

With the help of the merchant and his crossbow, the three take down the last bandit.

Grateful for the help, the merchant hires the group to guard him on the way to Cloahpool, the city to the west.

They direct the merchant, Sylis Olomyar, to the tavern. While Nim and Unknown goes to the shops to sell the gear looted from the bandits, Raashak heads to the hunters guild to inquire about jobs.

Empty Bucket
============

The team regroup at the tavern and stay the night. Nim performs well enough to get a free room for the night.

The next morning the group and Sylis head for Cloahpool. Upon exiting the town, Sylis informs the groups that he would prefer to avoid the roads and keep under cover.

Wilderness
==========

For the next two days the group travel with little difficulty, although they do see what appears to be a dragon fly overhead. It doesn't appear to spot them.

During the night, Raashak spots the creature again and alerts the group.

A White Wyrmling lands and a Drow immediately jumps off of its back and goes to attack Sylis.

The team make short work of the Drow, but the Wyrmling takes a little more effort, but they do manage to kill it.

After the fight, the team interrogate the supposed merchant and ask why he would have been targeted by a dragon.

Some persuasion and a little intimidation later, Sylis confesses to be carrying a message for the Lord of Cloahpool. A key to a prison has been stolen and the Lord needs to be informed.

Sylis offer a bonus of 30gp each for the killing of the dragon and for keeping the secret.

They decide to forgoe sleep and travel throught the night to reach Cloahpool by morning.

Cloahpool
=========

Taking Sylis directly to the Lord's keep, Sylis asks them to wait at the Melting Pot, a nearby tavern. Being slightly untrusting of Sylis, Raashak follows him into the Lords keep, but is stopped by guards trying to enter the main chamber.

Raashak joins the others at the tavern and waits for Sylis to return.
