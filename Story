Empty Bucket
============

Unknown drinking at the bar.
Nim trying to charm his way into a job singing at the tavern
Kaashak enters looking for work, directed to the job board. Nim, having been turned down for a job, joins him. Unknown, trying to avoid paying her tab, sneaks out among them.

Job Board
=========

Three jobs - Kashaak takes rat job, returns to tavern to find location of job and goes there, killing a good 20 rats.
Nim and Unknown go to a house to repair its roof. While Nim is outside scoping out the job, Unknown enters the house and steals a small wooden box. She leaves without being noticed.

Kashaak returns to the job board to take the last job, gathering of wolf pelts for Mary's Cloakes. He goes to the tavern to ask directions for someone who has pelts. Eventually directed to the Hunter's Guild.

Unknown shows Nim the way to the hardware store to buy wood for the wood. Unknown slips away and goes to her fence, where she sells the box and it's small collection of jewellery.

On way back to tavern, Unknown meets Kashaak and they both go to the Hunter's Guild to inquire about wolf pelts. They are given general direction for known wolf spots, and are challenged to clear a nearby dwarf mine of an 'infestation'.

They head back towards the tavern and split up.

Nim purchases the wood for the roof and takes them back to the house, on the way he bumps into Kaashak and he helps carry the wood to the house. He also lends his rope to Nim. With the rope, and some small pieces of wood, Nim makes a rudimentary pulley to help get the wood up to the roof.

Meanwhile, Unknown has gone back to the tavern and used some of her ill-gotten money to pay off her bar-tab.

Kaashak goes to a nearby shop to research purchasing a ranged weapon, but doesn't have enough gold.

Nim completes a good portion of the roof, and after a quick supper provided by the owner of the house, he returns to the Empty Bucket.

Empty Bucket
============

All three are now at the empty bucket and both Nim and Raashak decide to split a single room, Nim sleeping on the floor.

After a simple breakfast, all three decide to finish the roof together, and get it done in half a day.

Out-of-town
===========

All three decide to go wolf-hunting together.

Kaashak goes stealth, and the other two lose him.

Nim and Unknown find a sleeping wolf under a larged branched tree. Kaashak, who had been following the other two, comes out of stealth, startling Unknown. Together they kill the wolf, and another that came to its aid. The take the pelts, and a few other things.

Looking for more wolves, they come across smoke. They stealth up and find two kolbolds around a cooking pot.

After killing them, the group enter the abandonded dwarf mine they were guarding. After a few battles, and a little looting, they find that the kobolds are feeding, and actually worshipping, a Giant Octupus that is living in the underground lake.

A long, bloody battle ensues and the Gnome Bard Nim takes the killing blow. More looting occurs and the group returns to town to sell the pelts at Mary's Cloakes and Clothes.

Empty Bucket
============

Returning to the tavern, Nim finally convinces Tom that he is a decent musician and manages to sing for his lodgings.

The group sleep and the first part of the story is done.

Kashaak levels up.

Job Board
=========

In the morning, the three wake up and Unknown and Nim head to the message board to look for jobs. They see a single job, for collecting the harvest.

Meanwhile Kashaak goes to the Hunter's Guild to start an initiation. He is told to return in a few hours when someone will take him on his initial Hunt for the guild.

Nim does a little light shopping, while unknown goes to kill a bird to get a feather for Nim's magic.

Outside of Town
===============

They all meet up and exit the South Gate to search for wolves to pelt. They find some tracks that look like wolf tracks, but are far bigger. They also spot blood along the trail.

The Cave
========

They eventually find a cave where the wolf prints end. Kashaak realises the time and starts heading back to town to go to the Hunters Guild while Nim and Unknown enter the cave. They trigger a trap at its entrance, but manage to dodge out of its way.

The continue to enter and hear a wolf further ahead. They continue and find a small room at the end which contains the wolf and a man that appears to be patching up a wound on his leg.

Nim calls out to see if the man needs aid, to which the man responds by telling them to leave. After refusing to do so, the man commands his wolf to attack them.

After a brief spout, Unknown grabs the small gnome, Nim, and drags him out of the cave, leaving the wolf and the man behind.

Hunters Guild
=============

Rashaak returns to the Hunters Guild and accepts the initiation mission. Guided by a guild member, he goes on the hunt for a brown bear. After a short following of tracks, the bear is tracked down, but proves too much for the lone Rashaak to handle.

He returns to The Cave to see if his friends are still there but instead finds the man and his wolf. After a brief bout, upon which Kashaak is definitely on the losing end, he runs away and returns to the Town.

Job Board
=========

On the way back to the tavern, Unknown glances at the job board and reads the notice about the harvest job. She immediately sees the hidden code within in and knows that the Thieves Guild is offering a special job. Unknown returns to the tavern with Nim.

Empty Bucket
============

After a non-productive day, Unknown settles down to get some quality drinking time seen to and Nim once again sings for his lodgings.

Rashaak arrives and goes straight to his room.

After a quick breakfast the next morning, Unknown slips away from the party to go see her Fence friend, whom she knows is a member of the Thieves Guild.

She learns that a 'Special Item' was stolen from the Thieves Guild by an ex-member, and a bounty has been placed for the return of the item and the head of the man who stole it. She is given a brief description of the man and is told that he had a 'large dog' with him. She realises this is the same man that they fought the previous day and returns to the tavern.

She meets up with the other two who have decided to go back to the cave as a group to confront the man and his wolf. Unknown goes along with this.

The Cave
========

Rashaak rushes into the cave, narrowly missing a newly set trap, and is immediately attacked by the wolf. The other two arrive shortly afterwards and the three of them manage to dispatch the wolf and the thief with a little effort.

Seeing Unknown unsuccessully attempt to cut off the head of the man, Rashaak helps with a single clean blow.

While Nim removes the pelt of what he has now realised is a Dire-Wolf, Rashaak and Unknown search the room. Rashaak discovers an unusual feature of the room, but cannot do anything with it. Upon inspection, Unknown recognises it as a thief safe and manages to get it open. Inside is a small, shiny, metal box.

Taking the head and the box, Unknown, accompanied by the others, returns to town.

Hunters Guild
=============

With the pelt of a Dire-Wolf, Nim tries to sign up to the Hunter's Guild. May tells him that his initiation could begin in the morning. He then leaves to go to shopping.

The Fence
=========

Meanwhile, Unknown meets with her fence, who is very happy upon seeing the head of the dead thief and the box returned intact. Unknown is paid a reward and leaves to find the others.

Mary's Cloaks
=============

After meeting up, the three head to the Cloak store to sell there wolf pelt. After doing so, Rashaak and Nim ask to see the metal box, to see if they can determing what it is.

Uknown tries to convince them that she lost it, but is unable to decieve them. A short argument leads into Rashaak hitting Unknown. Mary orders the three to leave her shop. When Rashaak refuses, she calls for the guards who forcibly remove them from the store.

Outside, Unknown stalks off and Rashaak raises a javelin as if to throw it at her. The guard quickly grabs the javelin and tells Rashaak to calm down. Upon refusing to, Rashaak is arrested and escorted to the nearest holding cell where he stays the night.

Empty Bucket
============

Nim plays for his lodgings again and after a bring stint of drinking, Unknown goes to sleep.

Nim and Unknown level up.

Upon waking, Unknown finds a note has been left for her. It appears to be from the Thieves Guild, and is inviting her to join.

Roshaak is released and joins his allies at tavern. After a small breakfast, they all leave to go to the Hunter Guild to start the initiation.

Hunters Guild
=============

Ander takes the three on the initiation. They attack a bear and have nearly dispatched it when another appears. They finish up the first and make short work of the second.

Ander grudgingly admits that they have passed the test and inform them that they are now members of the Guild and are free to take Hunters Guild quests.

Ander stays to carve up the bears and the trio return to the city.

Road
====

On the road outside of Fallcrest the team spot a Merchant and two would-be bandits that are sneaking up behind him. Rashaak charges towards the bandits and Unknown shoots at them.

The team take down the two thugs and are then approached by another, better dressed bandit. He states that his two friends appear to have failed the test and attacks the group.

With the help of the merchant and his crossbow, the three take down the last bandit.

Grateful for the help, the merchant hires the group to guard him on the way to Cloahpool, the city to the west.

They direct the merchant, Sylis Olomyar, to the tavern. While Nim and Unknown goes to the shops to sell the gear looted from the bandits, Raashak heads to the hunters guild to inquire about jobs.

Empty Bucket
============

The team regroup at the tavern and stay the night. Nim performs well enough to get a free room for the night.

The next morning the group and Sylis head for Cloahpool. Upon exiting the town, Sylis informs the groups that he would prefer to avoid the roads and keep under cover.

Wilderness
==========

For the next two days the group travel with little difficulty, although they do see what appears to be a dragon fly overhead. It doesn't appear to spot them.

During the night, Raashak spots the creature again and alerts the group.

A White Wyrmling lands and a Drow immediately jumps off of its back and goes to attack Sylis.

The team make short work of the Drow, but the Wyrmling takes a little more effort, but they do manage to kill it.

After the fight, the team interrogate the supposed merchant and ask why he would have been targeted by a dragon.

Some persuasion and a little intimidation later, Sylis confesses to be carrying a message for the Lord of Cloahpool. A key to a prison has been stolen and the Lord needs to be informed.

Sylis offer a bonus of 30gp each for the killing of the dragon and for keeping the secret.

They decide to forgoe sleep and travel throught the night to reach Cloahpool by morning.

Cloahpool
=========

Taking Sylis directly to the Lord's keep, Sylis asks them to wait at the Melting Pot, a nearby tavern. Being slightly untrusting of Sylis, Raashak follows him into the Lords keep, but is stopped by guards trying to enter the main chamber.

Raashak joins the others at the tavern and waits for Sylis to return.

They ask the barman to see if there is a Hunters Guild in town. They find out there isn't, but that there is a Fighters Guild.

On the way to the Fighters Guild, they stop off at an armourer to see if they can turn their dragon scales into anything. The armourer tells them he can make a Dragon Scale shield with them. They leave the scales with him to pick the shield up in the morning.

They go to the Fighters Guild to see about joining. They are told that anyone can fight here, and that fights are usually scheduled after the work day is done. Nim signs up to possibly fight.

The party heads back to the tavern, getting into an argument with some guards over not letting them into the High Area.

At the tarvern, they find Sylis waiting. He proceeds to give them their gold and tells them about a mission he would like them to partake in.

He asks them to find the Eye of the Raven Queen. A magical device somehow connected with the Raven Queen, the Goddess of Death. It is needed to try and find the missing key. They are fronted 1000GP and promised another 1000GP upon retrieval of the item.

Given what they know of the Raven Queen, the association with death, they head to the prison to see if any murderers know anything of the Goddess. They meet a prisoner who tells them that he is not a holy man, and knows little of holy matters.

The team split up, with Raashak heading to a local temple, and Nim and Unknown heading to the local library.

Both teams find out that there used to be a temple to the Raven Queen in the mountains to the South.

The team meet up again and decide to do a little shopping. They find a wizard running a nearby item shop and ask him to try and scry for the Eye. He does so and tells them that is is being stored in a dark room, a long way to the South East. He sees what he thinks is a man walk passed a corridor outside the room. The team buy a few items and leave to go back to the tavern.

In the morning they pick up the shield and leave to go south.

The party moves quickly through Dewsbury and Azmar, ending up at the Azmar Pass, which goes through the mountains to Southern Taldoran.

Azmar Pass
==========

After carefully crossing a dangerous looking rope bridge, the party run into a group of Centaurs who inform them that the temple is nearby and given them some landmarks to look out for.

A little farther on, the party hear a stuck Centaur that got separated from its group. Raashak frees the centaurs foot by removing the rock trapping its foot. In thanks, the Centaur gifts the party its +1 Longbow.

Temple of the Raven Queen
=========================

The team eventually come to the massive doors of the temple of the Raven Queen. Opening the doors they see the massive entrance hall and enter, Unknown staying slight behind. Raashak and Nim look into one of the side rooms and alert a band of Goblins. An extended fight occurs with many Goblins, Hobgoblins and Bugbears.

After a short rest, the party start looting the bodies and searching the temple. Raashak and Nim explore the rest of the rooms. Raashak discovers a room with a rapier (+1) and some gold, while Nim discovers some magical arrows. He identifies two of them as fire arrows, but is unable to identify the third.

They all follow a tunnel leading out from the main hall, but they discover it has caved in. They see evidence that the various goblins and Bugbears were in the process of clearing it out, but there seems to be a lot still to do. Nim and Unknown rest while Raashak goes in search of the Centaurs to see if they can help. Unable to find them, he heads back.

Reunited, the team decide to continue through the mountains to Irragin and stay the night. Nim posts a sign up on a local job board for people to come and help dig out the temple.

Irragin
=======

Meanwhile, Raashak asks around and finds out that a local family, the Dwarven Moireach's, are a family rumoured to be connected with the Raven Queen. He asks for their where-a-bouts and is directed to an estate a few miles out of town. After a little shopping, he goes to investigate.

Meanwhile, Nim and Unknown wait around to see if anyone will respond to the job notice.

Moireach Manor
==============

Raashak arrives at Moireach Manor and is greeted by a Dwarf, the owner of the house. Raashak asks him if he knows anything about the Raven Queen. Moireach says that his family was once acolytes of the Raven Queen.

Raashak asks if there is perhaps a seconds, accessible entrance to the temple. Moireach claims there is, but is unwilling to reveal its existence at first, until Raashak convinces him. Raashak is led down to the basement and shown a secret entrance behind some shelves. He looks into the cavern behind the shelves and says he'll be back with his friends soon.

Raashak heads back to town.

Irragin
=======

As noone seem to be interested in a job moving rocks in a temple dedicated to the Goddess of Death, Nim heads to a local blacksmith to see about getting some weapons silvered. He is quoted a price of 50GP to get a longsword silvered. He heads back to the tavern.

Raashak arrives back in town and find Unknown at the tavern. Together they look around town for Nim, eventually being led to the blacksmiths. Raashak decides to get his longsword silvered. The blacksmith takes it and says he'll be done by the morning.

The party meet up again at the tavern and sleep the night.

In the morning Raashak tells the others of his discoveries at Moireach manor and, after picking up his sword from the blacksmiths, they all head back to it.

Moireach Manor
==============

A few hours later, they arrive at the manor and are greeted by Moireach. He helpfully equips them with some vials of Holy Water and two potions. He also gives them a Crystal Ball of Returning that, when crushed, will teleport the crusher and anyone standing next to them straight to the basement of this house. The trio go through the hidden door in the basement and head into the darkness.

Under the Mountains
===================

After a couple of hours of underground travel, the team find their way into a large cavern, the sound of water rushing in the near-distance. Raashak is surprised by an attack from an undead foe. The team quickly recognise their enemy as a Zombie and start their counter attack. A short battle with several zombies and a skeleton is won with only a little difficulty.

After a short rest, the team advance and find the source of the noise, an underground river. They find a stone bridge and cross with ease. On the other side they spot a dead body on the ground. Preemptively, Unknown fires an arrow into the body. Nothing happens. Raashak approaches and narrowly escapes being swipped ay by the, apparantly, undead body. He makes short work of it and decapitates it instantly. As he does, he sees a medallian fall of its neck. He grabs it and puts it on.

Following the cavern along the team discover more zombies and effortlessly, and stealthily, kill them.

While fighting, Unknown spots some faint light moving in the distance.

Raashak throws a rock towards them, but it takes much longer to land and make a noise than he would expect.

The team advance and find a massive ravine with a rope bridge. They cannot see the otherside, or the bottom. They quietly cross.

Getting impatient for a fight, Raashak yells out at the moving lights. Shortly after, out of the darkness come three Magic Missiles aimed right for him. Scared, Raashak runs back over to the bridge, first pausing to tie his rope to the post. Many zombies and skeletons approach, followed by a Flaming Skull.

While both Raashak and Unknown dash across the bridge, Nim tries to hide in the darkness.

As Raashak makes it to the other side of the bridge he is hit again by three Magic Missiles, only barely staying alive. Dropping his rope, he decides to keeps on running.

Nim is attacked by a trio of zombies that split off from the larger herd and Unknown tries to fight the first Flaming Skull, taking hits from both as she does.

After getting some distance away, Raashak uses his heavy crossbow to deal some damage to the Skull right at Unknown. The Skull retaliates and knocks Raashak out.

Alone, against two Flaming Skulls, Unknown manages to take one down, but is bested by the other.

Nim manages to defeat the three zombies at him and sneak past all the other enemies, that have now returned to this side of the ravine and gets to Unknown as she is on the brink of death and saves her. He drags her to Raashak and finds him unconcious, but stable. Healing him so he can move, the three slowly return to Moireach Manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Having suffered their first defeat, the team are despondent and upon arriving, Moireach offers rooms for them to recover in.

The next morning, as Unknown rests, trying to recover from her near-death experience, Nim and Raashak head to Irragin, Nim to buy a drum and a belt, and Raashak to look for information about the undead. Finding nothing useful, Raashak and Nim head back to Moireach Manor. Along the way, they find some tracks and decide to follow them East.

Wolarb Marsh
============

After an hour of following tracks, Nim and Raashak end up in a marsh. The two come across some snakes, that they switly deal with. Deciding that they've followed far enough, they head back to the manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Nima and Raashak return to the Manor and talk to Moireach about the temple and the undead. Moireach advises not going back down, but that Holy Water should help with defeating them.

In the morning, while Unknown remains resting, Nim starts praticing a spell he believes will help with the upcoming fight with the undead. Meanwhile, Raashak begins hunting around the manor looking for tracks.

He eventually find some tracks, that look like pawprints - bigger than a wolfs, but smaller than the direwolf's he'd seen before. After a few hours, he manages to track down a Death Dog. A fierce fight ensues and although he wins, Raashak is poisoned.

Raashak returns to the manor to find Nim practicing a spell - they both go inside and Nim explains his plan to both Unknown and Raashak. He plans to cast a Ritual of Silence on the Flaming Skulls and have Raashak get in close to not allow the Flaming Skull to leave the area of influence.

In the morning, Raashak realises that he is still poisoned and that his maximum HP has dropped. He decides to head back to Irragin to get a potion to cure him. When he arrives back Raashak, Nim and Unknown all go into the underground passage and head back towards the temple.

Under the Mountains
===================

It takes a few hours to get back to the first cavern and when they get there the three find the remains of the bodies they killed before. The head over udnerground river using the stone bridge and proceed to enter the next cavern. As they enter they a floating skull hovering around the location that Unknown had previously killed one. It appears to have regenerated itself.

Nim and Unknown hide behind a stalagmite and Nim begins casting a Silence Ritual aimed at the Skull. While this is happening, Raashak slowly creeps forwards towards the skull. As Nim finishes the spell, Unknown takes a shot at the skull and Raashak rushes forward. A short fight ensues and the team manage to easily take down the Skull.

Raashak, wanting to take no chances, sprinkles Holy Water on the skull and then procedes to throw it into the near-by ravine.

Now standing at the edge of the ravine, the team can see the light from the second skull in the distance. They stealthily cross the bridge and they decide to try the same plan again. Nim casts another Silence Ritual and Raashak prepares to run forward. As Nim is finishing the spell, he gives a nod to Raashak who now runs forward and charges the skull. The three manage to again, now working efficiently as a team, easily take down the Skull and the surrounding Zombies and Skeletons.

Nim throws the Skull over the edge of the ravine and the three settle down for a short rest.

Rested, the team proceed into the cave system. Not far on, the reach a fork in the tunnel. The left passage seems to head up and the right slopes down and to the left. Seeing some rubble at the bottom of the left slope, Nim forms an idea and, asking the others to wait for a moment, he heads up the left passage which he quickly discovers is blocked to due a cave in.

Nim returns to the others and tells them his discovery. The three decide that this is the passage that leads to the main entrance to the temple in the mountains and head down the left route.

After a few hundred meters, they get to an opening with a ceiling higher than they can easily see. Looking forward, they spot a light moving around. They try to stealth forward, but fail and the Flaming Skull starts to attack them. With Nim casting a Silence spell and Unknown and Rashaak managing to mostly keep the Flaming Skull in that area, it's quickly defeated.

After the fight, Nim notices another skull on the floor, this one cracked. Nim tries to destroy the skull, but fails. About to throw it, Nim holds it above his head and Raashak fires his crossbow at the skull, shattering it.

While this is going on, Unknown spots, above them, a rope bridge. Further on Nim spots and dangling rope hanging down the right wall. Nim climbs up it and takes a look around.

While Nim climbs up, Raashak fire his crossbow into the darkness in front of them and pays attention for a reaction. After getting no reaction, he moves forward to wear his bolt landed. When he gets there, he sees, in the distance a slight shimmer. Raashak moves back to Unknown at the rope.

Unknown and Raashak both climb up the rope and take a look around. Rashakk tells them both of the shimmer as they head towards the rope bridge. Getting to the bridge, they discover a rope tied to it - a rope tied to another which was is tied to the other end of the bridge. They realise it's the rope that Raashak tied to the bridge before and that they've gone around in a circle. Nim retrieves the rope and Raashak climbs back down.

Not wanting to climb back down, Nim pulls up the rope. While doing that, Unknown notices the piton used to anchor the rope and the Thieves Guild symbol engraved on it.

Nim and Unknown both go back round following the same route they did before and meet up with Raashak. They proceed forward to examine the shimmer.

They are attacked by three ghasts. It's a struggle, but they do manage to defeat them.

A short rest later they proceed forward and come to a stepped pyramid, made from a black, slightly shiney stone.

Speaking a little too loudly, Raashak is attacked by a ray coming from the top of the pyramid. Nim and Unknown hide against the wall of the pyramid and Raashak fires a shot in the direction of the ray.

Coming out of the darkness, the team see an undead beholder, and coming around the side of the pyramid are two zombies.

It's a long, touch fight, with Unknown nearly getting vapourised in a single hit, but the party manage to kill the enemies and get to the top of the temple.

Instead of the relic they were hoping to find, they spot an alter. They determine is was used for sacrifices to the Raven Queen. Unknown notices a symbol painted on the alter - it's the symbol of the Thieves Guild.

Nim notices some large groves cut into the right side of the top of the pyramid and, looking over the shear edge, notice many holes in the pyramid wall. It looks like someone has used climbing gear to sneak up the side of the pyramid.

Realising that the Eye of the Raven Queen has probably been stolen, and remembering back to the Wizards scrying and determining that this is not the place that he was describing, the team start to head back to Moireach manor.

Moireach Manor
==============

Getting back at late night, the team go straight to bed.

They all level up.

In the morning, they ask Moireach for directions to the nearest city. He hands them a map and points to Huckson, to the East.

In a hurry now, the party decides to cut across Wolarb Marsh to get to Huckson quicker.

Wolarb Marsh
============

They make it across half of the marsh without much difficulty and make it to the river.

While attempting to cross, they are attacked by alliagators. In the ensuing fight, Nim is taken down, but the other two manage to prevail. Nim is revived with a potion and they all cross the river.

They make it throw the marsh and manage to find a road. They follow the road to the city of Huckson.

Huckson
======

Now in Hukson, they start creating plans for how to find a member of the Thieves Guild. They go to a local tavern and try to get the attention of any members of the Guild by having Unknown use thieves cant in a conversation. It doesn't appear to work and they retire for the evening.

Raashak levels up.

In the morning, the party decide to leave a message on the job board, written with Thieves Cant, with the hidden message Fountain, West Gate, Midnight.

To kill time, the team head towards the Fighter's Guild to see about entering into a fight. Both Raashak and Nim sign up for a fight later in the day. They learn that the fighter's guild uses the Hunter's Guild to acquire animals for it for the fights.

While Nim goes to a local Guild of Artists and Entertainers, Raashak and Unknown head to the Hunter's Guild to see if they have any jobs. When they get there, they hear a struggle 'round back and go to see what is happening. they see some hunter's wrestling with a large beast. After asking if they require help, Raashak and Unknown are told that everything is under control. After seeing another hunter cast a spell, putting the beast to sleep, the two head back 'round to the front of the Guild where they meet a member of the Guild and ask about jobs. He doesn't give any specific jobs, but does tell them that they are always on the look out for rare animal parts and even new and rare new species of creatures. Raashak sells them some parts for a little gold and he and Unknown return to the tavern where they planned to meet Nim.

At the tavern, the team decide to explore the surrounding area while waiting for the fights to start in the evening. They head west, past D'holden, a Dwarven Town, and end up back at the edge of Wolarb Marsh where they have a quick battle with some poisonous snakes and head back to Huckson.

Now later in the day, the team return to the Fighter's Guild.

They witness another first-time fighter fight a bugbear and win.

Raashak and Nim both decide to fight a bugbear each. Raashak is first up and struggles a little at the beginning, but eventually overcomes the bugbear with little difficulty.

Nim has a little more difficulty, but is equally victorious.

The team collect the winnings they had from the bets they made and stay to watch the remaining fights.

The last fight of the night is two fighters, neither new-comers to the Fighter's Guild, but neither are exceptionally experienced either. They are against a Chirmera and are swiftly knocked out. Before the Chimera can completely kill the two combatants, another member of the Guilds steps out from behind them and casts a powerful spell of the Chimera, putting it to sleep.

As it's nearing midnight, the team go the the fountain near the west gate and see if anyone will show up for their secret meeting. Nim and Raashak hide nearby and Unknown stands near the fountain, waiting for a member of the Thieves Guild. They wait for an hour, but noone appears to show up.

Nim and Unknown return to the Tavern and go to sleep. Raashak stays behind for another hour but doesn't see anything and returns to the tavern.

A few hours later, during Unknowns Meditation, she hears he door open and opens her eyes and sees a man in dark clothes leaning against the door. Unknown explains to the man that they are looking for the Eye of the Raven Queen. The man doesn't appear to know what that is and says that information is not given out freely, or cheaply, to non-members. Unknown goes and wakes up Nim and Raashak in the next room.

With the help of Nim, Unknown convinces the man to initiate them into the Thieves Guild. The thief gives them a simple task, to go to Murkshear and retrieve a bag from a dwarven ex-merchant, Targ Crest-Hammer, to whom the bag was mistakenly sold with a rare and precious item still hidden within.

After the party agrees to the initiation test, the man leaves and the team go back to their rest.

Nim and Unknown level up.

In the morning, Nim goes to a local shop and spends some of his winnings from the previous day's fights to purchase some healing potions. Afterwards, the team head out the South Gate towards Murkshear.

Road to Murkshear
=================

Half way along the road to Murkshear they party get to a bridge and see three people with large dogs. As they get closer they see that two of the dogs are infact Direwolves and one is a Deathdog. Initially acting friendly, the three men turn out to be bandits and attack the group.

A bloodly battle ensues leaving only one of the men, and none of the animals, alive.

Nim restores life to one of the other men, but the last is too far gone to heal.

The last man is told to leave and never bother them again. He takes his still living friend with him as he leaves.

The team continue to Murkshear.

Murkshear
=========

The party arrive at Murkshear at night and head straight for the nearest taven, The Pink Jug, and get rooms for the night.

In the morning the party splits up to find out information about Targ Crest-Hammer. Nim talks to the barman, Unknown goes to the Town Hall and Raashak goes to a nearby shop.

Nim learns that the mayor was recently killed in a hunting accident and that there is will soon be candidates announced for the position. Nim heads towards the Town Hall.

Meanwhile, Raashak heads to a nearby shop to try and find out about the Merchant Dwarf, Targ. Raashak learns that Targ is a fairly wealthy merchant and most likely lives in the richer part of town, to the North. Raashak goes to take a look around.

Rogue gets to the Town Hall where she finds a crowd of people outside. She learns that the candidates have just been announced for the new Mayor, one of whom is Targ Crest-Hammer. She also learns that he is currently inside the Town Hall, and that he lives at the North of the Town. She heads north.

Raashak gets to the richer part of town and starts looking for Targ's house. After a little trial-and-error he finds it, claiming to be delievering a package. A human, who appears to be a butler, comes to take the package, but Raashak claims he left it on his cart and will be back soon. Raashak heads south to find the others and runs into Unknown. They exchange information and Unknown heads to Targ's house and Raashak heads to the Town Hall.

Nim looks around the Town Hall and finds a secluded spot and disguises himself. He enters the Town Hall and has a look around. The desk in front of the door is empty and he has a quick look around. He glances over some minutes or a previous meeting. Nim hears talking coming from an adjacent room and goes to investigate. He sees four dwarves and two humans talking. Nim introduces himself as Sylus and asks for Targ. One of the Dwarves says that he is Targ Crest-Hammer. Nim claims he has come from the Lord of Cloahpool to help in in his campaign for Mayor and to take him out to lunch. Targ turns down the offer of lunch and resumes talking to the others. Nim stays and listens.

Rogue, now at Targ's house, has a look around and discovers a secluded secondary entrance to the grounds. It looks like a service entrance. Rogue notes it and returns to the Town Hall.

While Nim is listening to a conversation about the election, Raashak walks in. Nim tries to convince the people around him that the Half-Orc is an assassin here to kill Targ. Raashak pulls out his weapon and shouts Targ's name. Nim uses a spell (Viscious Mockery) to drop Raashak, who plays dead. Guards are called and Raashak is arrested.

Nim convinces Targ that someone is trying to kill him and that the Lord of Cloahpool sent him here to make sure that didn't happen. Targ is unimpressed with the gnome and asked to see proof he was sent by Robert Summerthorne (Lord of Cloahpool). Nim shows him the seal of Cloahpool given to them by Sylis. Nim implies that it might be his opponent in the election who is trying to kill him. Targ looks at the Dwarf on his left and asks him, Bran Ironforge, if he is trying to have him killed. Bran looks insulted that anyone would assume he would hire anyone so incompentant to kill someone.

Nim convinces Targ to go back to his manor for safety. Targ and Bran decide to go back to Targ's manor, and allow Nim to tag along. Unknown follows behind them, stealthily.

Inside, Nim makes mental notes of the layout and asks Targ to question his staff and the 'assassination' attempt. Targ reluctantly agrees, still not really seeing a threat. Nim finds a cook in the kitchin and asks him about food preparation and Targ's schedule. Nim wants to look in the store room, which is locked. He gets the cook to open it up and takes a quick look around. The cook asks what he is doing, and Nim responds that he's making sure that the food isn't poisoned. The cook gets suspicious and takes Nim to Targ to find out what is going on. Targ has had enough at this point and asks Nim to leave.

With Raashak in jail, Nim and Unknown try to come up with a plan to get him out. They try pretending to be lawyers in order to get in to see Raashak, but the guards are having none of it.

As a secondary plan, Nim disguises himself as a little boy and casts Invisibility of Unknown. Unknown sneaks into prison, carefully getting past the door to the cells and picking the lock on Raashak's prison door.

Meanwhile Nim has entered the prison claiming to be a little boy whose brother was arrested. Feeling sorry for him, one of the guards shows him the cells to see if he can find his brother. Unknown sneaks out as Nim and the guard pass them. After not finding his brother, going past Raashaks cell he touches him and casts invisibility on him.

In the main room of the prison, the guards suggest that he should stay here instead of wandering the streets. Nim plays a little tune to distract the guards from Raashak opening the door behind them and from stealing the keys to the storage room. Raashak manages to find his stuff in the storage room and feeds it through a small window into the alley besides the prison.

Raashak manages to sneak out of the prison and retrieve his stuff and Unknown goes into the prison claiming to be 'the little boy's mother and retrieves him.

Outside Raashak and Nim get into a physical fight while planning the heist of Targ's home.

Now getting dark, the party decide now is a good time for the heist. Nim casts invisibilty on Unknown and she heads off. Unknown successfully picks the side entrance and enters the kitchin. She looks around the store room and a small upstairs section which seems to be the butler's quarters. Outside, Nim sneaks in the side gate and 'round to the front of the house to keep watch.

Outside the gate, Raashak rings the bell next to the gate. Raashak tries to convince the butler that opened the door that Targ is in possession of a bag that he needs. The butler, not knowing what the Half-Orc is talking about, tells him to leave and closes the door. Raashak fires a crossbow bolt at the door and goes to hide. Having heard the bolt, the butler uses a magic to contact the guards.

Unknown sneaks back downstairs and towards the entrance hall.

Raashak spots two guards coming to Targ's manor and sees them ring the bell. The butler, not knowing what the Half-Orc is talking about, tells him to leave and closes the door. Raashak fires a crossbow bolt at the door and goes to hide. Having heard the bolt, the butler uses a magic to contact the guards.

Unknown sneaks back downstairs and towards the entrance hall.

Raashak spots two guards coming to Targ's manor and sees them ring the bell. The butler (Raan) opens the gate and lets the guards in to the house. Unknown opens the door to the hall and sees Raan, Targ and the two guards standing in the entrance hall, discussing the attack by the Half-Orc. Raashak fires another bolt at the door. The guards rush out and engage Raashak. Nim is forced to use a Stinking Cloud on the guards to help Raashak get away, which drops his concentration on Unknown's invisibility.

Now visible, but with Targ and Raan distracted watching the fight, Unknown manages to sneak through the entrance hall into the dining room and then to upstairs. She checks out a guest bedroom and heads to the master bedroom.

Nim, meanwhile, having watched Raashak run away, makes himself invisible and enters the side entrance and sneaks to the master bedroom. Nim and Unknown find the bag, as described, in the wardrobe. They exit the bedroom and hear the butler and Targ leave the entrance hall. They manage to sneak out of the house and join up with Raashak and head to The Pink Jug.

On the way, they inspect the bag and discover it to be a Bah of Holding.

In the morning they head back to Huckson.

Huckson
=======

Upon arriving in Huckson, the team find Unknown's Thief contact and show him the bag, who puts is hand in and retrieves an orb from within. Having successfully passed the initiation test, Unknown, and the party, are taken, via many twists and turns, to thew Thieves Guild.

As they enter, they hear a heated argument between two men and a women, discussing a commission that seems to have failed. At seeing the party and their contact enter the room, the man and women pull out weapons and attack. A long battle ensues, with what turns out to be an Incubus and a Succubus, with Nim being temporarily charmed by the pair and attackign his allies. The team and the two thieves manage to beat the pair.

The team find out that the pair had commissioned a job to steal the Eye of the Raven Queen, which the thieves had done, but upon discovering its power to locate magical (and therefore expensive) items, they decided not to hand it over to them and keep it for their own purposes instead.

The party manage to convince them to hand it over to them to 'Save the World', but Unknown decides to stay with the Guild to train up.

Nim and Raashak leave and head to Cloahpool.

Meanwhile in Cloahpool
======================

Another team of adventurers: Kardak, the Dwarven Barbarian; Patrin, the Dragonborn Cleric; and Ander, the Halfling Druid, are given a task by the Lord of Cloahpool to transport an important item to Halderry in Yrenlion. The item they are given is stored in a magically sealed box, perfectly smooth on all faces. They are told that it's not important how long it takes, just that it reaches the destination safe and in secret.

They have easy travellings for a few days, but on the third they run into a herd of Owlbears inside a dense forest. Their first real bout of combat for a while, the team revel in the kills.

Shortly after their fight, Kardak spots a woman running through the trees. Ander transforms into a Giant Eagle and flys above her to see what's happening. He spots a man chasing after her. Kardak and Patrin hear the woman laughing.

Ander lands in front of the pair and the man draws his sword. Ander lowers his head and acts submissive. The woman stop the man from attacking and walks towards Ander and says that she can see him.

Ander transforms back into a Halfling and greets the two. The man, Carric, and the woman, Mara, invite him and his friends back to their homestead.

The homestead consists of four home and a storage silo. The team talk to Carric and Marra about the town and go to meet Rieta, a Tiefling.

As the sun sets, the team hears noises coming from the silo. Kardak, shortly followed by Ander and Patrin, goes to investigate and as they get close, the silo door bursts open and several Helmed Horrors and Flameskulls.

As the team battle the threats, some of the enemies attack the homesteaders. The homesteaders attack back, but Mara is taken down. After the enemies are killed, Patrin heals Mara, saving her from dying.

Leaving the homesteaders to tend to themselves, the group head into the silo to see if there's any more danger. Inside they find a trap door in the silo that leads down into the dark.

Underground they find a dungeon, and in the first room they find a bunch of Air Elementals which, thanks largely to Ander's Sun Beam, they destroy. Feeling confident from that battle, Ander rushes into another room which, he finds, contains an Efreeti and a Salamander. The Efreeti starts to charge Ander and Ander slams the door shut and tries to hit the Efreeti through the door with a Fire Wall. He destroys the door, but has no apparant effect on the Efreeti.

The barbarian and the cleric both jam the doorway and attack the Efreeti. The halfling, Ander, sneaks past the Efreeti and tries to pick up the Salamander and fails. Annoyed, he attacks the Salamander, killing it.

The Efreeti is eventually defeated and, now tired and wounded, the team retreat back to the Silo. They shut the trapdoor and weigh it down with boxes and bags of grain. They fall asleep on the bags.

In the morning they find that the boxes and bags are back in their original positions. Ander looks outside and discovers that the remains of the Helmed Horrors and Flame Skulls have disappeared. The team go and talk to the homesteaders who don't appear to remember them.

After a short discussion, the team send Ander into the Dungeon as a Fire Elemental to talk to the Efreeti, assuming that it has caused some magical effecto to take place. Ander manages to sneak past the Air Elementals an into the room with the Efreeti.

After a short conversation, in which the Efreeti professes to know nothing about what is going on, and certainly doesn't remember dying the previous day, Ander returns to his team mates.

Not knowing what is causing the magic, whether it is the item they are transporting or something about the Homestead or Dungeon, they manage to convince the people of the Homestead to leave with them, convincing them that a danger lies beneath.

The other people of the town are revealed to be Vondal, a Dwarf; Cade, a Halfling; and Vola, a Half-Orc.

Together they all leave to the West. Ander transforms into a Dire-Wolf and scouts ahead.

After a few hours travel, the group run into a group of Gricks, who are swiftly defeated.

Later, as the sun sets, the group makes camp. Before getting everyone to sleep, Ander hands the villagers paper and writing implements and asks them to write letters to themselves in order to convince them that something is afoot.

Ander takes first watch.

The party wake up, once again, in the storage silo.

A quick looks reveals that the paper Ander got the villagers to write letters on is back in his pack, with no writing.

The party goes 'round the village to see if people remember them, but no-one seems to.

Ander asks Carric what year he believes it to be and he responds with a year over 120 years ago.

Kardak performs a ritual to learn about the land around them from his Bear Spirit Animal. He learns that the above ground landscape is fairly standard, but that there is a large empty space beneath them. The bear refers to it as a Cavern, but it appears to be referring to the Dungeon beneath the silo. He also states that there are lots of different types of creatures around, elementals, undead, even a dragon.

The team decide to leave the village and watch from a distance to see what happens.

From their vantage point, they see Carric and Mara leave to go hunting, and some general activity around the village. Shortly before sunset, Carric and Mara return and Ander uses his wildshape to become an eagle to fly above the village to keep watch.

As the sunsets, with all of the villagers in their home, Ander sees the door to the silo open, and careful inspection leads him to see Air Elementals come out and head towards the villagers houses.

After a few minutes, the Air Elementals leave the home and head back to the silo, disappearing within.

Ander lands and changes back into a Halfling. He checks on Carric and Mara's house to find Carric dead in the main room and Mara dead in the bedroom.

Going outside, he waves his friends over. The three split up to check the remaining houses.

Ander finds Vondal and Cade both dead in the main room of their house.

Patrin finds Rieta dead in her bedroom.

Kardak find Vola alive in the main room of her house, but only barely. He calls the others over and they question Vola about what happened. They here about the Air Elemental attack. They question her about her reasons for coming to the village and various question about the other inhabitants. As she answers, Vola begins questioning her own reasons, as if not quite convinced that her own memory is accurate. After the questioning, Vola falls asleep with exhaustion. Kardak carries her to the bed.

Now late at night, Ander transforms into an Air Elemental and re-enters the Dungeon, this time using his form to pass through the locked door, into a room full of Skeletal warriors. He manages to sneak passed them and into another room with a Swamp Monster in it. After some trickery, he manages to get passed it and into another room, in which he is attacked by unseen assailents.

Rushing passed, he gets to a room he has already seen, one containg an Efreeti and a Salamander. He turns back and takes another door off of the one with the invisible enemies and finds a corridor. Following it, he comes to some stairs. Following them down he comes to a small room with desks piled with books and paper, and a large, very ominous door, one he cannot pass through in his Air Elemental form.

He tries to break down the door, but to no effect. He comes out of his Wildshaped form and looks over some of the papers and books. He sees notes about the attacks happening on the villagers, checking the last few days of notes to see that it mentions the attack they first saw and the Air Elemental attack that happened earlier in the day.

In anger, Ander rips out the remaining pages of that Tome and uses the ink, to write in big letters with his fingers "Tomorrow, you will die".

Ander heads back up the stairs and follows the corridor the rest of the way 'round to find a dead-end, but with small slivers of light around what looks to be a secret door.

In his weak, halfling form, Ander has trouble pushing the door open, but manages to open it enought to see some of the Helemed Horrors that they saw on the first night.

Meanwhile, Kardak is investigating the village houses and find diaries and papers detailing the few weeks since the villagers arrival. One mentions a small conflict between Mara and Vola, but doesn't mention what it was about. He mentions the conflict to Patrin.

The team wakes up in the silo.

It becomes quickly apparant that the last thing that Kardak remembers is setting up camp with the villagers - he appears to not remember the previous day at all.

After getting Kardak up to speed and Ander and Patrin conferring with everything they learned the previous day. Patrin talks to the villagers to try and find out what the conflict between Mara and Vola was about, to see if it will shed any light on the current situation. It turns out that Mara's family was largely killed during the war with the Half-Orcs, and Vola being a Half-Orc lead to some tension between them.

The team decide to try and head west on their own, thinking that without the villagers they may be able to leave.

About 100 meters out, at the edge of the clearing the village is situated in, the party notice some cart tracks, the same cart tracks they made two days ago. They deduce that the reset doesn't affect the land outside of a certain radius.

It takes all day, but they manage to travel to their campsite from two days previous, which is still there. They carry on travelling all through the night.

The teams wakes up in the silo. This time, it is Ander and Patrin that appear to have forgotton previous events, with Patrin not remembering the previous days travel and Ander not remembering the previous two. Kardak struggles to get them caught up.

Once caught up, the team decides to go into the dungeon. Ander, once again, transforms into an Air Elemental and goes into the dungeon, finding the other Air Elementals, he manages to convince them to not attack the party that will be shortly arriving. Doing a little more exploring, Ander drifts through a door and spots a Legendary Beholder. It doesn't appear to notice him, so Ander drifts back throught the door and goes to reunite with his party.

After explaining what he saw, the team decide to go down and fight it.

Creeping past the, hopefully neutral, Air Elementals, the party make their way to the Beholder. Ander transforms into an Earth Elemental and glides through the Earth to come up behind it and the fight begins.

Patrin gets paralysed early on, but Ander and Kardak manage to give it without taking too much damage.

Now not sure that this was the reason for the problems above, the party continue to explore. Patrin finds a room with Helmed Horror's in and remembers that Ander told her about a secret passage near them.

Entering the room, the party quickly dispatch the armours and Ander, still in his Earth Elemental form, destroys in a single punch the wall he failed to push open as a Halfling.

The trio enter the corridor and go down the stairs.

They enter to find the previously closed doors now open.

A voice booms out, "You're Late!"

The party walks through the door to the brightly lit chamber beyond, finding, upon a massive throne-like chair, an old man.

Before anyone can really react the old man launches a spell at Ander, who earth glides into the ground.

The fight starts in earnest, with the old man launcing many spells and the parts doing plenty of damage back.

Eventually, the old man appears to lose patience and transforms into a massive Brass Dragon.

It takes a little time, bit the team manage to defeat it, relatively unscathed.

Taking more time to read throught the notes, it appears that the Dragon, named Umberoth, was conducting research on the villages, whom it summoned to this village, but having them various types and numbers of monsters. It was apparantly looking for a way of improving various species in order for them to deal with greater levels of evil.

Making their way back through the dungeon, the team come to the villagers and once again convince them to leave with them.

As before, they travel west and at night, make camp.

This time, the team and the villagers all wake up at their make-shift campsite in the woods. The, now larger, party continues west into Yrenlion, towards Halderry.
